Step 1: Inject this script into any game using a Lua injector like JJSploit
Step 2: When you get the ready notification, spam the space bar to jump as many times as you want

Controls:
Reinject the script to toggle the infinite jump script on or off.
Execute Lua "G.infinjump = true" to explicitly turn the infinite jump script on
Execute Lua "G.infinjump = false" to explicitly turn the infinite jump script off
